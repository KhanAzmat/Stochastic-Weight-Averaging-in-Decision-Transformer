# Stochastic-Weight-Averaging-in-Decision-Transformer
We try to better generalise the performance of decision transformer by using the Stochastic Weight Averaging(SWA)  while training. We have tried two approaches with SWA. We used the vanilla SWA when training the decision transformer and also introduced noise along with SWA, while training. We tried our algorithm on the hopper and halfCheetah environments. And,we found that  SWA and SWA with noise got better scores when compared to the original Decision Transformer.
